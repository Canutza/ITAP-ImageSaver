# ITAP-ImageSaver
A Reddit bot that takes the Imgur pics from /r/itookapicture save them to your computer

To config it just remove .example from confing.json, you must have a table in the database specified there named 'pictures' and just one column 'rid' CHAR 10.

@TODO:
1. Watermark the pictures
2. Support Flicker
3. Support full Imgur urls
